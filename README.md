ProtectTheHoney is an adaptive cybersecurity project that attempts to combine honeypot deception with reinforcement learning to create a self-learning defense system. ProtectTheHoney continuously learns from attacker interactions and adapts its defense strategies turning a passive honeypot into an intelligent, evolving security mechanism.
